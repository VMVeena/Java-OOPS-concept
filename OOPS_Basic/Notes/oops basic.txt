*********>Inheritance<*******************
 *Inheritance is a fundamental concept in Java and a key feature of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). 
 * It allows one class to inherit the properties and behaviors (fields and methods) of another class
 * Private variable are not able to inherit
 * If we want to call specialized methods from parent refernce we need to do down cast parent to child
 * Whenever any child constructor will call first "super" method will be executed. Use of super method is
   to call constructor of parent class
 * this() mehtod is used to call the constructor of same class
 * We are not able to use super() and this() method at same time  
 * Parents class will always extends Object class by default
 * Both static variables and static method get inherited in child class.
 * Method Hidding: When  we attempt to override static methods in child class then it will become specialized method by hiding inherited static
 method and we cannot override static method.


***********>Rules for overriding Methods<************
1. We cannot decrease the visibility of overriden methods in child class however we can increase 
2. We cannot change return type of overriden method in child class.
3. We  can change return type of overriden method in child class if its co-veriated return type.
(co-veriated meas if there is a "is-a" relationship between return type of overiiden methods.
4. We cannot change parameter list of overidden method in child class if we change it will be trated as specialized method.


***********>Polymorphism<*********** 
* Polymorphism in Java is one of the core concepts in object-oriented programming (OOP) 
that allows objects to behave differently based on their specific class type.
* We can achive it by method overridden and creating a parent class refernce for child class.

***********>Abstract Key<************
1. In java we can have methods without body/defination.
and such methods ar called as abstract methods and declared using abstract keyword.
2. If any one method in class is abstract then it class should be declared as abstract class.
3. We cannot create object/instance of abstract class.
4. We can create ref to achive polymorphism.
5. a class and mehtods can be abstract but variables and constructors are not abstract.

Not: Abstract and Final keyword cannot used at once. Its illigale to use both of them at a time.
***********>Final*****************

1. final class cannot be inherited (we cannot inherited from final class)
2. final methods can be inherited however we cannot override them 
3. final variable cannot be re iniatialized (nehave as constant)
